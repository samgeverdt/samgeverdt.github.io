"I am a college junior with a strong academic foundation in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and data science. In addition to my academic achievements, I have gained significant work experience in various fields, including disaster relief with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) during my pre-college gap year and my current work with UMBC research, USDA, and FEMA.

My work in disaster relief has allowed me to develop strong leadership, teamwork, logistical, and communication skills, which have proven valuable in all aspects of my life. I have applied my experience in analysis and modeling using ArcGIS PRO, QGIS, ENVI, and Google Earth Engine. Furthermore, I am conversant in Python and R programming languages, as well as SharePoint.

My strong work ethic was demonstrated by my commitment to part-time employment through high school, and I am now a conscientious self-starter eager to contribute and learn in a business environment. I am also Non-Competitive Federal Hiring eligible through Americorps NCCC completion for four years after the program.
Currently, as a UMBC Data Science Scholar, I have developed projects using R, Python, ARCpro and QGIS to analyze data within maps. I have also created and designed new data and metrics for measuring potential flood hazards around Baltimore City. Alongside professionals, I conduct research on public health, transportation, and economic growth. Additionally, I mentor information science students and assist in teaching coding and data analytics.

During my time as a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Student Intern, I created the Emergency Response Directorate dashboard for FEMA, which is used nationally for various regions to converse and share data. I collaborated with Emergency Response Directors across the nation to develop efficient deployment strategies and analyzed workforce data across all regions for deployment optimization. I also created a SharePoint drop site for emergency data to be stored and visualized.
Furthermore, as a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) FNS Data Analyst, I worked with other federal agencies to identify the best data metrics, data visualization, and geospatial tools to inform partners and the public during a disaster. I collaborated with FEMA and the Red Cross to develop an early 'damage assessment metric' at the county or more granular level to communicate to leadership in the most heavily hit areas. I also worked with the analytics sub-group on their resilience measure and to identify and create equity metrics being developed across the United States.

Before my current work, I was a part of the FEMA Corps, a competitive professional development program for 18- to 24-year-olds providing community disaster relief. I started out as a team member before taking on added responsibility as a lead program manager. My key accomplishments include being the Program Delivery Manager DR-4442-MN (Minneapolis, MN), where I piloted and led the first team in the program dedicated to facilitating the public assistance application process, including information collection and customer service. Additionally, I was responsible for initiating and managing $300K in infrastructure grants and developed 400+ location and flood insurance maps (FIRMettes).

I also served as a team member in AmeriCorps National Civilian Conservation Corps after successfully completing FEMA Corps Training Institute, Academy, Basic, and Public Assistance Training. During my service, I completed 1,700+ hours of community service with a diverse team of seven members assisting in disaster recovery, and I also served as the team Transportation and Wellness Coordinator to support logistic and health needs. Lastly, I assisted the TSA K9 threat detection team with security testing at Minneapolis International Airport.

When I am not working in disaster relief or conducting research, I am a competitive powerlifter who holds several state records and enjoys craft beers and good puzzles. I also substitute teach science courses, instructing students grades 5-9 in earth science, math, and geography. I am currently attending the University of Maryland, Baltimore"
